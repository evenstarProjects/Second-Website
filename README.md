# Second-Website  
 
For our final project, we need to create a website that will solve a problem for a community you are part of, or create a community to solve a problem for society.  

Some problems/solutions you may wish to consider are:  
1. Making safe spaces.
2. Targetting environmental issues.
3. Promoting equity, inclusion, and social justice.  

When working on this project, you should:
1. Use GitHub to store your code and make regular commits when adding content or making edits using the branch system.
2. Create a website that includes:
    - A minimum of 3 pages.
    - A stylesheet that makes the website work on desktop and mobile devices.
    - Accessibility features as standard.
    - Some form of interactivity using JavaScript.
