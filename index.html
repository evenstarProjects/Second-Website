                            We are Helix: Holistic Fitness Training, where fitness meets balance. We are passionate about helping people achieve their wellness goals, regardless of their circumstances. At Helix, we understand that it isn't always logistically viable to join a gym or find a Personal Trainer. Whether it be due to finances, disabilities, or any other personal barriers, sometimes our health and fitness can feel inaccessible. For that reason, we decided to keep the platform as accessible as possible to as many people as possible.

                        <h3>Our Mission:</h3>
                        <p>
                            At our core, we believe that everyone should have access to exercise, no matter your gender, sexuality, ethnicity, body shape, religion, disability, or additional needs. No matter who you are, you are a human being with a human body, which deserves to be treated with care and respect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It may seem quite blatant for me to say at first, but listed above are just a small handful common barriers to fitness that many people face every day. If you have never faced the kind of thing I'm talking about, no worries! This space is for you too. But to those of you who know what it's like to walk into a gym and feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or even unsafe in your previous gyms, I want you to know that <b>you are welcome <i>here</i></b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our mission is to empower you with the tools and support you need, to create positive and lasting change in your life. Once you understand how <i>you</i> work, we can implement techniques that are centered around you, <i>your</i> abilities, <i>your</i> needs, and <i>your</i> values. Together, we build strength from the inside out.

                        <h3>Total Fitness: more than a luxury gym chain!</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ever heard of the term "Total Fitness" before? Many people in the Fitness Industry will talk about health and fitness like they only mean one thing. It may be "how much can you lift?", "how far can you run?", or "how many calories are you eating?". But health and fitness have so much more to it...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That's why we like using the phrase "Total Fitness" with our clients. Total Fitness describes the ability to cope with many problems and stresses that they have been dealt from modern-day life. Exercise puts the body under stress, and the body learns how to recover. With consistent training and practice, the body recovers from this stress more efficiently. But the same can be said for other stresses we go through. When we overcome anxiety, our brains learn and make adaptations to our Neuropathways, so the next time we experience anxiety again, we can deal with it more efficiently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That's why Total Fitness is so important to look at when undertaking a new Fitness Regime. Our bodies are affected by so much more than exercise, and so we have to adapt our approach based on what our individual needs are. Total fitness is a multi-dimensional concept that encompasses our emotional, social, spiritual, mental, nutritional and physical fitness. Neglect just one of these, and our sense of self can be completely off-balance.
                        </p>
